    Dpm tree refers to the HTMl page where all the nodes are objects . These can be 3 main types.
    1).TEXT NODE 
    2). ELEMENT nodes
    3). COMMENT NODE.
    In an HTML page ,<html> is at the root and <head> and <body> are its children ,etc.

       **  A text node is always a leaf of the tree.
       Auto Correction 
       If an erroneous HtMl is encountered by the browser it tends to correct it for example , if we put something after the body , it is automaatically moved inside the body . 
       Another example is <table> tag which must contain <tbody>.

        There are two terms that we will use from now on 
     1). Child notes (or Children) ---  Elemnts that are direct children. In other words, they are nested exactly in the given one. For instead.
     <head> and <body> are children of <html> element.
     2). Desecendants --- all elements that are nested in the given one . including children their children and so on .
     For instance . here <body> has children <div> and <ul> and 
        (few blank text nodes).
        and desecendants of <body> are not only direct children <div>.<ul> but also more deeply nested elements such as <li> (a child of <ul>)and <b> (a child of <li>)- the entire subtree.
            The childNotes collection lists all child nodes , including text nodes.
